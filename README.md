# BTC/USD Trading Bot for Gemini Exchange

This bot is still under development, but will act as a template for those wishing to trade BTC/USD with a bot on Gemini.
A user will be able to download all the files (and necessary programs), insert their API keys from their Gemini account,
and find optimal settings for the different trading strategy tools (or add their own) using the back testing
functionality.  More info and details will be added to this README as the project progresses, and please note that I am
neither a professional trader or programmer (yet!) so use at your own risk.

I would like to give some credit to [bwentzloff](https://github.com/bwentzloff), as his YouTube tutorial and bot for Poloniex
is what inspired and influenced me to make this bot.

If you have used this bot and enjoyed it, and would like to make a donation, you can donate to the following:
