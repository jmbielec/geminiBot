# BTC/USD Trading Bot for Gemini Exchange


## IMPORTANT: This bot is not currently being developed due to issues with Gemini's Sandbox API and more, see below

Details: I originally took a break from developing this project when Gemini's Sandbox repeatedely was down or not fully functional, limiting my ability to test anything.  Around that time school picked up and I resorted to just running data_scraper.py daily to collect exchange data for backtesting.  However, I discontinued even this as during that several month period the market had crashed and I planned on this bot working off of sideways price action, so most of the data I was collecting/had collected was useless.  I plan on continuing development when the market recovers and I have more free time.

<s>This bot is still under development, but will act as a template for those wishing to trade BTC/USD with a bot on Gemini.
A user will be able to download all the files (and necessary programs), insert their API keys from their Gemini account,
and find optimal settings for the different trading strategy tools (or add their own) using the back testing
functionality.  More info and details will be added to this README as the project progresses, and please note that I am
neither a professional trader or programmer (yet!) so use at your own risk.</s>

I would like to give some credit to [bwentzloff](https://github.com/bwentzloff), as his YouTube tutorial and bot for Poloniex
is what inspired and influenced me to make this bot.
